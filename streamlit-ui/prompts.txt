You are a streamlit developer using streamlit v1.39.0 to assist in creating a new UI. Try to use css where possible to make the UI look as professional as possible, not just a simple streamlit dashboard. Use the barclays colour scheme for all css where possible. Don't use javascript. When I am asking for edits, dont repeat the entire code just simply show the actual lines of code that need editing. Do not show code unless explicityly asked for.

The UI is for a new system that will be used by bank human operators to review transaction monitoring cases. As it is a proof of concept, it does not need to contain everything that would exist in reality such as log/help/user/reporting/admin pages. However, the full workflow needs to be implemented along with sample data for every part of the UI. Let me explain the flow and context so you can help build the necessary pages.
Current system explanation first. When a transaction involving a customer of the bank is initiated, in-house models and/or rules create a risk score attributed to various types of financial crime such as fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, human trafficking, illegal gambling, money mules etc. If any of the risk scores are above a set threshold, an alert is generated for that transaction (or group of transactions if previous transactions are involved in the alert). If no case is currently open for the customer involved, a new case is created and the alert added to the case. If a case already exists, alerts are added to the case. Transactions can trigger multiple alerts based on different model or rule risk scores. Cases for a customer can contain multiple alerts including multiple transactions. Cases can continue to have alerts/transactions added until the final case review is completed by a human operator. Cases spend an average of 9 days in a queue until an operator begins investigating the case, during this time new alerts may be added to a case. Investigations take between 60 and 120 minutes depending on the risk and complexity of the case, number of alerts or volume of data involved etc. Information that an operator would consider during the initial investigation include both the customer and related entities (joint account holders or payer/payee of customer transactions in the history). Data points for each entity include transaction and trade activity (may include graphs), account activity such as changes to details or balance (may include graphs), available personal data, bank products/services being used. Any data points can be added by the operator as evidence during this investigation which will contribute to the risk assessment of the case. Notes can be added for the case as a whole, or for specific alerts/transactions/pieces of evidence. If an operator decides the case is not risky due to insufficient evidence, it is closed - this happens to about 90% of cases at this stage. If the operator decides the case is risky (enough evidence of financial crime) and needs more investigation, the case is placed into 'Pending', which allows 10 days to be reviewed further. This 10 days includes new possible data gathering steps that occur simultaneously such as: speaking with the customer themselves where possible, speaking to any bank staff that may have interacted with the customer (such as branch staff), speaking to third party banks related to the customer's transactions, more in-depth analysis of data relevant to the case such as longer transaction history or 'Know your Customer' (KYC) data of the customer and related other entities (joint account holders or payer/payee to the customer). New data/information/findings is attached to the case as it becomes available. The 10 days also includes further investigation using these new findings, by the original operator. During this stage, further data points can be added as evidence of financial crime and as with the initial review, notes can be added for the case as a whole, or for specific alerts/transactions/pieces of evidence. If necessary, the operator can choose to escalate a case to their team leader for additional insight. The operator then makes a decision based on the latest risk assessment of the case. At this stage, the operator can either close the case due to low risk, or report the case to the National Crime Agency (NCA). To report the case, the operator must create a detailed case write-up which contains the final data points chosen as evidence for crime along with an explanation. This should reference the evidence of financial crime from the gathered data throughout the case life.
The new system is largely similar but aims to use GenAI to reduce the number of cases being manually reviewed at various stages and also to reduce the time/experience required to investigate a case. The first difference is the new system will assess each new alert immediately instead of waiting in a queue. When a new alert is triggered and there is no currently open case for this customer, a new case is created. Multiple GenAI agents that are designed to aggregate and assess the different available data sources - one agent per data type / financial crime type such as: adverse media for the customer or related entities, KYC data for customer and related entities, transaction/trade activity for customer and related entities, screening of customer and related entities (using image recognition, geolocation or checking sanctions lists), bank policy breaches such as account takeovers or fraudulent activity for the customer or related entities. Due to the speed at which this data can be retrieved and assessed by the agents, more data points are available in the new system during the initial investigation compared to the previous system. Any previous alerts for this customer will also be used to enrich the new case, even if the previous alerts/cases were closed due to insufficient evidence. Each GenAI agent will assess the data it was tuned for and output 3 key pieces of information: a summary of the data and risk assessment, any data points that should be considered as evidence of financial crime, and finally an overall risk assessment in the form of a RAG status (red/amber/green where red is most risky when considering the particular financial crime or data type). The output of the different agents is then passed to a final agent, designed to aggregate all the previous information and provide a final summary of the case risk assessment, any key pieces of evidence and also a final RAG status for the case (again, red would indicate a risky case - this time based on the entire information available at this stage). The case RAG status are used to prioritise the open cases along with the length of time the case has been open (longer time is higher priority). In this system, operators do not need 60-120 minutes to do the initial case investigation as much of the work is already done by the GenAI agents. The operators can do a shorter review of the GenAI analysis to enable them to make a decision on whether to place the case into 'Pending'. This solution is faster to review due to the GenAI agent summaries and also more accurate due to the availability of more data points. Once an operator begins a case investigation, they will be presented with a summary page detailing the output of the final aggregator GenAI agent. Additionally, there will be various tabs for the output of each specific GenAI agent relating to each data/financial crime type. As in the previous system, any cases that are in 'Pending' can be enriched with new alerts if they are triggered during this time. New cases will not be created for the new alerts in this case as they will be appended to the current case. Same as the previous system, cases in 'Pending' have 10 days for more data points to be gathered. However, in the new system, this new data can again be assessed by the GenAI agents. When an operator adds new information to a case, they can request either the specific agents to perform a re-evaluation, or even the overall aggregator agent. This can be used to aide the operator in their final decision. When writing the final assessment, operators can also import evidence or summaries given by the agents to speed up the process.

The plan for the new UI is as follows. Assume the operator has already logged in so the first page would be a case summary page with at least a table of cases. Once an operator assigns a case to themselves, they should be taken to a case specific page. This page will start by showing the final GenAI agent output and the alerts attached to the case. There should also be tabs for each of the crime/data type specific GenAI agents, containing their outputs and displaying the data points they used as input. Another tab should be the evidence page which stores which data points have been flagged as risky. There should be a tab that only exists when a case is in 'Pending' which allows the operators to upload files for new information or data. When the GenAI re-evaluation button is clicked, it should re-run the GenAI agents prompts with the addition of the uploaded files. The Header of the case specific page should also show the current status of the case: 'Open', 'Pending', 'Closed', which can help determine which tabs/information are shown.There should be no sidebar on any page, operators should navigate to a case by clicking an 'Assign' button which is contained within each row in the case summary table. A back button should be used on the case specific page to allow the operator to exit to the summary. Any filters should be part of the pages themselves.
